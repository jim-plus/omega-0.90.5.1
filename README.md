# omega-0.90.5.1

Source code (rescued from archive.org) for omega 0.90-pa9-1, a roguelike, tweaked to compile cleanly on modern Linux, tweaked to use ncurses (again) instead of GTK-based tiles.
Version numbering above is provisional.
The code appears to be later than 0.90.4 by a few months, and fixes code generation that broke in a modern C compiler.
